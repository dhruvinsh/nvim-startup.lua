# nvim-startup.lua

> minimalistic startup time feedback

## Installation

Install it with your plugin manager of choice: 

#### [`paq-nvim`](https://github.com/savq/paq-nvim)

```
paq {'henriquehbr/nvim-startup.lua'}
```

#### [`vim-plug`](https://github.com/junegunn/vim-plug)

```
Plug 'henriquehbr/nvim-startup.lua'
```

...And you're done, no need to setup any initialization, it will work out-of-the-box, just reload your nvim and hopefully you will see a message just like that:

```
Launched in <x> ms
```
